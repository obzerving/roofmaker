# roofmaker
 Inkscape extension to help make roof pieces for 3D papercraft designs. It also designs the pieces for dormer windows of several types.

Installing:
 
Copy roof_maker_start.inx and roof_maker_start.py into your Inkscape user extensions directory. Where is that? Open Inkscape and go to the System section of the Preferences menu (Edit --> Preferences --> System). You will find a User extensions item containing the path to your user extensions directory.

Usage:

See the file [Roof_Maker_Usage.pdf](https://github.com/obzerving/roofmaker/blob/main/Roof_Maker_Usage.pdf) for details.

Note:

This extension (for Inkscape version 1.1.) is still under development and the code reflects it. It's functional, but not yet bulletproof, so be mindful of the input constraints in the usage document.
